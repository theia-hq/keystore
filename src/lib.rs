//! Storage for a node's secret key: one [`Secret`], one versioned file format, and the codecs that
//! load, write, adopt, and lock a key file.
//!
//! A key file holds one ed25519 seed of one [`Kind`]. The kind says what the key is for, a device's
//! own key or a root key, and is chosen by naming the file ([`KeyFile::device`], [`KeyFile::root`]);
//! a sealed file of the other kind is refused, and a root key is never written plain. A file is plain,
//! the raw 32-byte seed, or sealed: a random file key seals the seed, and a lock wraps that file key.
//! The format holds a list of locks, at most one per [`Method`], and any one opens the file; the only
//! method is `passphrase`, so a sealed file has one lock, and a root key always keeps it.
//!
//! The locks are a property of the FILE. They are read from the file's own bytes, never from
//! configuration, and they change only when [`KeyFile::add_lock`] or [`KeyFile::remove_lock`]
//! rewrites the file. [`KeyFile::load`] states which case it found (nothing there, a plain key, a
//! locked key) or why it refuses, and it never returns a key the file does not hold.
//!
//! This crate stores and unlocks; it decides nothing else. Where a key file lives, whether an absent
//! one should be created, how a passphrase is obtained from a person, and what the key signs all
//! belong to the caller. That split is enforced by what the crate depends on, and pinned by its tests.
//!
//! The secret itself never leaves a [`Secret`] by value: it is lent out through a borrow
//! ([`Secret::with_bytes`]), and every buffer that holds it here is wiped on drop. What this cannot
//! stop is a copy the caller makes on purpose: a seed is a `Copy` array, so
//! `secret.with_bytes(|seed| *seed)` compiles to a bare `[u8; 32]` that nothing wipes. Hand the borrow
//! on instead: the transport binds take `&[u8; 32]`, so `secret.with_bytes(bind)` makes no copy.
